        <p>
          Hi, I am a self-taught developer, based in Mar del Plata, Buenos
          Aires, Argentina with a focus on web development. I am currently
          studying Programming at UTN.
          </p>
        <p>
          At the time of coding, I always try to maintain good practices and my
          code clean. In addition to the logic behind the programming, I like
          user experience and enjoy a good design.
